How to build with legos:

Tools needed:
legos - classes?
instructions - data from outside source.(maybe) url?

We can make classes to create a blueprint for the boxes/legos. 
We could then have a could copy the coordinates and dimentions of a premade model given to the code.
In the real world, we would simply look at the instructions and click the pieces together.
In the code, we will have to give the code specific instructions to look at the data, copy it,
enter it into the code, and finalize it. 
It would also need to be able to call on the class in main.py.
